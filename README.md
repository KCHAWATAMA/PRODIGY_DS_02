A comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). We begin by loading and inspecting the dataset, 
handling missing values, and removing unnecessary columns. Categorical variables are converted for analysis. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, 
we explore relationships between various features, such as age, fare, and passenger class, to uncover patterns and trends related to survival rates.
Visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps, help illustrate key findings and insights. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of 
the dataset and inform further exploration or predictive modeling.
